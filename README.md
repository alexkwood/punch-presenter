# Punch Presenter

Create HTML5 Presentations quickly using [Punch](http://laktek.github.com/punch) and slide deck based on [Google's HTML5 Slides](http://code.google.com/p/html5slides/).

Modify `cotents/slides.json` and add your slides there. You may use the slide templates already provided there. 
If you need to modify presentation's HTML markup or styles, you may find them in `templates` directory.

## How to generate the slides?

* First, you will need to install [Punch](http://laktek.github.com/punch). 
* Then go to your presentation's directory and run the command `punch`. 
* Open `public/slides.html` in your browser.
